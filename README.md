# Python walker
This is an early version of a recovered package to walk Python data structures, in particular `sys.modules`.

## Documentation.todo
- Give some kind of outline of what it is trying to do.
- Describe the walker:
	- order of the walk, occurs checks;
	- depth limits;
	- the visitor and the various payload data functions.
- Describe the module walker.
- What walker methods are and how to define them:
	- the implicit global list;
	- and its deficiencies.
- Module dependency graphs:
	- why they are not really well-defined;
- Module tools:
	- recursively finding modules;
	- sanity checking `sys.modules` in various ways.

## History
I (Tim Bradshaw) wrote the original version of this package as a tool to try and draw pictures of data structures in Python programs: by walking over the structures and emitting something which could be parsed by a graph-drawing tool such as [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/)[^1].  In particular it was used to draw graphs of module dependencies.

The code now in `pythonwalker.mt` originated rather later and separately, as a sanity-checker for `sys.modules`[^2].

Everything has since been somewhat revamped for more recent Python versions: it probably won't work in anything older than 2.7.

[^1]: Originally, in fact, this spat out Lisp sexps which were injested by [LispWorks](http://www.lispworks.com/) and drawn using its grapher.

[^2]: Why a sanity-checker for `sys.modules` is *needed* is a question I have wondered about: couldn't it just map module names to modules?  I think the answer is that, if it did that, it would be a many-to-one map, and na√Øve programs which walked over `sys.modules` would then walk each module multiple times.  That's not a good reason, but it's the only one I can think of to explain this idiocy.
